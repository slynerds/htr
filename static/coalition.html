<h4>Our Coalition</h4>
<h1 class="name">We Must Face Climate Change Together</h1>
<p>Haiti Takes Root unites people and organizations to confront the challenges of climate change. HTR is spreading
	information and raising awareness about strategies that can help families adapt to changing weather patterns, while
	at the same time leveraging our collective voices to access international funds that can help Haiti test and promote
	innovative responses to the global challenge of our century.</p>

					<h4>Haiti Takes Root</h4>
					<h1>The Coalition</h1>
				</div>
				<p>Haiti Takes Root (HTR) is a new approach to Haiti’s environmental crisis. Instead of creating a new
					organization, HTR is an initiative to strengthen capacity and coordination among existing
					stakeholders in order to manage Haiti’s natural resources and adapt to the impacts of climate
					change. In order to break out of the pattern of project cycles and isolated, individual efforts, HTR
					unites actors to embrace approaches grounded in lessons learned over decades, in Haiti and beyond.
